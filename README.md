# LovejoyBot

LovejoyBot is a bot used by NMU TLC students to receive notifications of their work hours, which are scheduled on lovejoy.nmu.edu.

LovejoyBot has two main areas of functionality:

* Screen-scraper for gathering work schedules. lovejoy.nmu.edu is unfortunately not RESTful.
* AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) service. User account (lovejoybot) is active 24/7 so students can ping for up-to-date notifications.

NOTE: The lovejoybot service is no longer active since I've graduated and had my access expire.
NOTE2: This was my first real hacking experience with python, so the code is rough.
